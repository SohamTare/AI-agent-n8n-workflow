# 🤖 AI Chat Agent using n8n + OpenAI + SerpAPI

This project is a simple yet powerful **AI Agent built with no-code using [n8n](https://n8n.io/)**.

It listens for a chat message → uses OpenAI to interpret the message → queries **Google Search (via SerpAPI)** → responds contextually, with memory.

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'm currently exploring:

- Advanced chaining (tool selection, function calling)
- Integration with Telegram/Discord bots
